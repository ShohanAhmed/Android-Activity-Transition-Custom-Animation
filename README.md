If you want to change your activity transition animation, this project is for you.

Here I overwrite the default activity animation and it is working for every Android version.

You will get "CustomActivityAnimation" in the Style file and 4 corresponding animation files in the "anim" folder. It's so easy and you can change animation by modifying  animation files. 

Thanks
